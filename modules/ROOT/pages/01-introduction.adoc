= Introduction

Introduction to PocketBeagle 2 board with information on each component location on both front and back of the board.

PocketBeagle 2 is based on https://www.ti.com/product/AM625[Texas Instruments AM6254 SoC]. Its quad A53 cores provide higher performance than the classic PocketBeagle. The new design comes with pre-soldered headers, 3-pin JST-SH 1.00mm UART debug port, USB-C port, MSPM0L1105, 512MB RAM, and LiPo Battery charger.

== Comparison

The board is intended to provide functionality well beyond classic PocketBeagle, while still providing compatibility with PocketBeagle's expansion headers as much as possible. There are several significant differences between the designs.
